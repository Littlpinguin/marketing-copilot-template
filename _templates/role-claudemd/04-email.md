## Newsletter workflow

### 1. Before drafting

- {{COMPANY_MAIN_CONTACT}} supplies topics for the month.
- Read the last 3 files in `newsletter/editions/` and check `_templates/inventory.md` for topic overlap (anti-repetition).
- Audit pillar balance across recent editions.

### 2. Draft

- Full draft at `newsletter/drafts/NL_{{MONTH_YEAR}}.md`.
- All sections filled.
- Subject line under 60 characters; preview text not a copy of the subject.

### 3. Brand check (mandatory before push)

Invoke `brand-check`. Block on 🔴.

### 4. Human validation

{{COMPANY_MAIN_CONTACT}} reviews.

### 5. Push to {{EMAIL_MARKETING_TOOL}}

- Always dry-run first: `python3 scripts/dry-run-push.py --target {{EMAIL_MARKETING_TOOL}} --file newsletter/drafts/NL_{{MONTH_YEAR}}.md`.
- Review the payload that would be sent.
- On confirmation, the connector creates a draft (never auto-send).

### 6. Schedule and send

{{COMPANY_MAIN_CONTACT}} reviews visuals and timing in {{EMAIL_MARKETING_TOOL}}, then schedules the send.

## Universal email rules

- Subject line under 60 characters, personalization merge tag when relevant
- Preview text always distinct from the subject
- One primary CTA per section
- Mobile-first rendering
- Unsubscribe link always present
- Legal compliance: GDPR (EU), CASL (Canada), CAN-SPAM (US), whatever applies to the audience
- Always consult archived examples in `editions/`, `promos/`, `sales-outreach/` before drafting
- Never send without explicit human validation

## Skills associated

- `email` — primary authoring
- `copy-editing` — 7-pass review
- `brand-check` — mandatory validation

## Final validation

Every draft must pass `brand-check` before delivery and **before** any push to {{EMAIL_MARKETING_TOOL}}. Brand-check runs before push, never after.
