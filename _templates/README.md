# _templates/

Source templates used by the wizard to generate operational files. You rarely need to touch these by hand — the wizard reads them, substitutes placeholders, and writes the resulting files to the appropriate location.

## Contents

```

```

## Which command uses what

| Wizard command | Reads | Writes |
|---|---|---|
| `/brand-discover` | `_templates/brand/*.md` | `01-brand/voice.md`, `style-guide.md`, `personas.md`, `messaging-framework.md` |
| `/tools-setup`   | `_templates/role-claudemd/<role>.md` | `<role>/CLAUDE.md` for each of the 9 roles, with tool placeholders substituted |
| `/tools-setup`   | `_templates/connector-stub.py.tpl` | `_integrations/connectors/<tool>.py` for every stub tool selected |

## Customizing the templates

You can edit these before running the wizard — your changes will be the starting point for every regenerated file. If you edit them after setup, nothing happens automatically: re-run `/tools-setup` or `/brand-discover` to apply changes, or apply your edits manually to the generated files.

## Conventions

- Placeholders use `{{UPPERCASE_UNDERSCORE}}` (Mustache-style). Canonical list in `docs/placeholders.json`.
- English only, per the template's operational language rule (content produced by the cockpit still follows the brand language you pick at setup).
- No secrets. If a template references a secret, it references the **env variable name**, never the value.
